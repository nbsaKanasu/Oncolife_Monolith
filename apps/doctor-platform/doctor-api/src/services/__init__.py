"""
Services Package - Doctor API
=============================

This package contains the business logic layer of the application.
Services coordinate between the API endpoints and the data repositories.

Architecture:
- Services handle business rules and validation
- They use repositories for data access
- They can call other services for complex operations

Usage:
    from services import ClinicService, StaffService, AuthService
    
    clinic_service = ClinicService(db)
    clinic = clinic_service.create_clinic(request)
