"""
Base Model Classes - Doctor API
===============================

This module defines base classes and mixins for SQLAlchemy models:
- DoctorBase: Declarative base for doctor database models
- PatientBase: Declarative base for patient database models (read-only)
- TimestampMixin: Adds created_at/updated_at fields

Usage:
    from db.base import DoctorBase, TimestampMixin
    
    class StaffProfile(DoctorBase, TimestampMixin):
        __tablename__ = 'staff_profiles'
        id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
        ...
"""

# Declarative Bases

# Base class for doctor database models
