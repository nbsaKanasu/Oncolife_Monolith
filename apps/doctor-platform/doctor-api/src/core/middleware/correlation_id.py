"""
Correlation ID Middleware - Doctor API
======================================

This middleware handles correlation IDs for request tracing:
- Extracts existing correlation ID from request headers
- Generates a new one if not present
- Adds correlation ID to response headers
- Makes correlation ID available for logging

Header: X-Correlation-ID

Usage:
    The correlation ID is automatically set in the logging context
    and can be accessed via:
    
        from core.logging import get_correlation_id
        correlation_id = get_correlation_id()
