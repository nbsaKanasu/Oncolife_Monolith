Request Logging Middleware - Doctor API
=======================================

This middleware logs all incoming requests and outgoing responses.
Provides structured logging for monitoring and debugging.

Logged information:
- Request: method, path, query params, client IP, user agent
- Response: status code, response time
- Excludes: health check endpoints, sensitive data

Usage:
    Applied automatically via setup_middleware()
