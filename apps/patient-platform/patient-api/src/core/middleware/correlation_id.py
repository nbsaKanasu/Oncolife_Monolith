"""
Correlation ID Middleware for Request Tracing.

This middleware:
- Generates a unique correlation ID for each request
- Accepts existing correlation ID from X-Correlation-ID header
- Adds correlation ID to response headers
- Makes correlation ID available for logging

The correlation ID enables tracing a single request across:
- Multiple log entries
- Microservices
- Async operations
- Error reports

Usage:
    The correlation ID is automatically available in logs:
    
    logger.info("Processing request")
    # Output: {"correlation_id": "abc-123-def", "message": "Processing request", ...}
